# Visual Conference talks
Slides for my presentations in [Visual;Conference](https://vnconf.com/) 2018 and 2019 organized by [Randy Au](https://medium.com/@Randy_Au).

# 2019 - VN Development Pipeline

> VN development is a gnarly process. Writing, programming, art and music asset creation, scene direction… it can be a staggering amount of moving parts to manage, not to mention the business and marketing components! This talk will cover a development pipeline to creating a playable and presentable build. This is what I wish I had known when I started as a new dev, and I hope to provide seasoned devs ideas they can tailor to their specific team/project situation. Note: examples in this talk use Ren’Py engine, but the same logic should apply to any tool.


# 2018 - Marketing a VN - What Steam Greenlight Taught Me

> Going through Steam Greenlight shortly before it was replaced by Steam Direct was a marketing opportunity to engage with potential audience and start work on marketing and getting coverage. This talk is about what I learned, and what worked and what did not.
